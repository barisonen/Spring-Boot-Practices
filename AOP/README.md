# AOP

Run the project & check the logs. <br/>

Scenario: <br/>

There is a bad car service in the neighborhood where sometimes an error occures while processing the payment. <br/>

There are Before, After & After Returning Advices. <br/>

Whether there will be an error or not is random. If there is an error, you will see an extra log (from After Returning), <br/>

Try several times to see all advices from the **Aspect** to the **Join Point** via **Pointcuts**.
